This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 

This is a machine-learning assisted content analysis of reading notes taken by the participants of a reading group for the McGill PhD Seminar MGMT710: Designing Social Science Research, taught by Diana Dakhlallah, Winter 2021.

```{r}
#preamble
setwd("~/Documents/OneDrive - McGill University/R/Projects/notes710") #working directory

#required packages
library(gsheet) # my raw data is in a google sheet

```

The first step in this process is cleaning and arranging the raw data, the texts.
I have pasted the text from the notes in a google sheet (minus formatting). Now to import it into r.

```{r}
notes<-gsheet2tbl('docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2eWivCgCpU74-U0paQXfWAWNKo_O1euxua7JlXbJWo')
notes
```
